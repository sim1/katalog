# katalog

The katalog is a curated, opinionated Kustomize catalog of applications I find myself deploying over and over again.

## kube-prometheus

Kube-prometheus includes almost everything to get started with Prometheus on Kubernetes.

The default Kustomize resources fail to address persistency and ingress.

### Usage

See `kube-prometheus/deploy` files for an example usage.
